# CARE DAQ - A WiFi based 4 Channel Biomedical Data Acquisition System
## This ESP32 DAQ uses the in-built ADC channels of ESP32 microcontroller and acts as a TCP Server and if any client gets connected, it starts sampling the 4 analog channels at 200Hz sampling frequency and sends the data to server.
## ESP32 Firmware has been done with Arduino. And the PC application is done in MATLAB.
## The source code is tested with PPG and ECG signals
## If you are using this source code, please cite the following paper.
